# Reds Social League

WordPress plugin for MURVC's social volleyball league: teams and rosters
now; registration, payments, fixtures, results, ladders and ratings to
come, in three phases (see `CLAUDE.md`).

## Registration and team building (0.2.0)

A **Social League** page is created automatically (`[rsl_my_league]`).

- **Register** — free, a short profile: highest level played, years
  playing, positions, and an optional free agent flag.
- **Cleared to play** — needed before a player's first game, not to join
  a team: a **full or life club member** (read live from the MURVC Club
  Manager) is covered; anyone else needs a **social rego** — 12 months
  from payment, bought through the rego product (set on Social League →
  Registration) or added by an admin. Renewing early starts when the
  current rego ends. A membership that lapses stops covering them the day
  it ends. Past rego purchases (13 months) can be picked up in one click.
- **Captain path** — a registered player applies for a team (name,
  division, colour) and becomes its captain. It's pending — not public, no
  players — until an admin approves (the captain is emailed the invite
  link) or declines with a reason (also emailed). Captains can withdraw.
- **Player path** — join with the captain's **invite link or code**
  (straight onto the team; registering through the link joins too), or
  accept an **email invite** from a captain. Email invites need the
  player to accept; until then the captain sees only the email they typed.
- **Captain tools** — roster with ✓ cleared / ✗ needs rego (never *why* —
  membership or rego is personal; admins see it), copy invite link, make a
  new link, invite by email, cancel invites, remove players.
- One team per person per season; a pending application counts.

## Teams and rosters (0.1.0)

- **Seasons** — four a year (Pre-season, Mid-season 1, Mid-season 2,
  Post-season). An admin picks the current season; public pages show it.
- **Teams** — Social League → Teams: add a team (name, Ranked or Unranked
  division, colour), rename it, change division or colour. Each team gets
  a permanent public link from its name.
- **Rosters** — add players by account email or username, choose a
  captain (one per team), remove players (kept in history). One team per
  person per season.
- **Public pages** — a **League Teams** page is created automatically:
  teams grouped by division, each with a badge (initials on the team
  colour) and size. Each team has its own page at `/league-teams/{team}/`.
  Public pages never show player names; a team's roster is visible only
  to its members and admins.

## Development

Local Docker copy of the site, WP-CLI test scripts in `dev/tests/`, and a
pretend league from `dev/fake-season.php`. See `CLAUDE.md`.

Requires WordPress 6.0+ and PHP 7.4+ (tested on 7.4 and 8.3).
