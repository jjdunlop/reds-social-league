# Reds Social League

WordPress plugin for MURVC's social volleyball league: teams and rosters
now; registration, payments, fixtures, results, ladders and ratings to
come, in three phases (see `CLAUDE.md`).

## What works so far (0.1.0)

- **Seasons** — four a year (Pre-season, Mid-season 1, Mid-season 2,
  Post-season). An admin picks the current season; public pages show it.
- **Teams** — Social League → Teams: add a team (name, Ranked or Unranked
  division, colour), rename it, change division or colour. Each team gets
  a permanent public link from its name.
- **Rosters** — add players by account email or username, choose a
  captain (one per team), remove players (kept in history). One team per
  person per season.
- **Public pages** — a **League Teams** page is created automatically:
  teams grouped by division, each with a badge (initials on the team
  colour) and size. Each team has its own page at `/league-teams/{team}/`.
  Public pages never show player names; a team's roster is visible only
  to its members and admins.

## Development

Local Docker copy of the site, WP-CLI test scripts in `dev/tests/`, and a
pretend league from `dev/fake-season.php`. See `CLAUDE.md`.

Requires WordPress 6.0+ and PHP 7.4+ (tested on 7.4 and 8.3).
